### But why we need X-TAG which is our new smart infrared shooting sport system:

* current related product are,
* very expensive
* Companies with large indoor environments charge up to $10 for a single game.
* Not enough game modes/options.
* Not smart enough.
* Not updatable


### So we planned develop a new system which is:

* Shoot father up to 100ft
* And make cheaper to produce 
* And most importantly we want to make our system smart.


### Target audiences:

* Companies  for Commercial laser tag systems ,
* and any other user who like to buy a pair of guns or more.
