### X-TAG  Smart infrared shooting sport:

Infrared games are originated in the united states as a replicate of star wars laser wars 
which is a popular movie hit.Now laser/IR shooting sports are popular in all over the world.
There are many Commercial laser tag and Toy class guns are available in the market now.

### But why we need X-TAG which is our new smart infrared shooting sport system:

* current related product are,
* very expensive
* Companies with large indoor environments charge up to $10 for a single game.
* Not enough game modes/options.
* Not smart enough.
* Not updatable


### So we planned develop a new system which is:

* Shoot father up to 100ft
* And make cheaper to produce 
* And most importantly we want to make our system smart.

# Hardware list 

### IR emitter

This is the heart of the this project and it is very challenging when we use IR communication for this kind of
purpose.
**To shoot further we Planned used high power IR**       
	IR emitter - TSUS5202
		power=   170mW , 150mA
**Since Atmega IC cant give 100 mA for the transistor is used**
	BD139
**and a lens is used to focus**
	-   Diameter about      38mm (1.5â€³)


### IR reviser

 - SM0038 - TSOP1738 - 38KHz IR receiver 	
 - This Moduile has built in   
 -  signal amplifier
 -    2.5 V to 5.5 V
  
### LCD screen 16x2 with I2C module

 - standard HD44780  	
 - 5V

### sunder

 - Buzzer Piezo Bleeper Sounder  	
 - Frequency 4kHz 	
 - power - 10mA
 - 
### vibration motor
	
 - 10000RPM Metal Brush
 - 	DC 3.7V 5V  135mA-180mA

And also push button and RGB LED are used.



### Target audiences:

* Companies  for Commercial laser tag systems ,
* and any other user who like to buy a pair of guns or more.

# Back-end technologies
Firebase
-   Cloud Firestore is used.


# Database
- Two main collections are used to store Player data and Match data.
- Player collection will store records as documents according to the Used ID.
- Match collection will store records as documents according to the Match ID.
- Players' details of each match will be stored as a sub collection inside the relevent match document.
