#X-TAG  Smart infrared shooting sport

Infrared games are originated in the united states as a replicate of star wars laser wars 
which is a popular movie hit.Now laser/IR shooting sports are popular in all over the world.
There are many Commercial laser tag and Toy class guns are available in the market now.
 
But why we need X-TAG which is our new smart infrared shooting sport system
current related product are,
very expensive
Companies with large indoor environments charge up to $10 for a single game.
Not enough game modes/options.
Not smart enough.
Not updatable

So we planned develop a new system which is,
Shoot father up to 100ft
And make cheaper to produce 
And most importantly we want to make our system smart.

Target audiences 
Both,
Companies  for Commercial laser tag systems ,
and any other user who like to buy a pair of guns or more.
