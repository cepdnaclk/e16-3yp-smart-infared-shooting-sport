### X-TAG  Smart infrared shooting sport:

Infrared games are originated in the united states as a replicate of star wars laser wars 
which is a popular movie hit.Now laser/IR shooting sports are popular in all over the world.
There are many Commercial laser tag and Toy class guns are available in the market now.

### But why we need X-TAG which is our new smart infrared shooting sport system:

* current related product are,
* very expensive
* Companies with large indoor environments charge up to $10 for a single game.
* Not enough game modes/options.
* Not smart enough.
* Not updatable


### So we planned develop a new system which is:

* Shoot father up to 100ft
* And make cheaper to produce 
* And most importantly we want to make our system smart.

# Hardware list 

### IR emitter

This is the heart of the this project and it is very challenging when we use IR communication for this kind of
purpose.
**To shoot further we Planned used high power IR**       
	IR emitter - TSUS5202
		power=   170mW , 150mA
**Since Atmega IC cant give 100 mA for the transistor is used**
	BD139
**and a lens is used to focus**
	-   Diameter about      38mm (1.5â€³)


### IR reviser

 - SM0038 - TSOP1738 - 38KHz IR receiver 	
 - This Moduile has built in   
 -  signal amplifier
 -    2.5 V to 5.5 V
  
### LCD screen 16x2 with I2C module

 - standard HD44780  	
 - 5V

### sunder

 - Buzzer Piezo Bleeper Sounder  	
 - Frequency 4kHz 	
 - power - 10mA
 - 
### vibration motor
	
 - 10000RPM Metal Brush
 - 	DC 3.7V 5V  135mA-180mA

And also push button and RGB LED are used.

SM0038 - TSOP1738 IR Receiver


3 pin
 2.   38KHz
 3.   -40 to +80C
 4.   2.5 V to 5.5 V
 5.   binary (data)

## **Budget**

Microcontroller-ATMega328 =  LKR 350
Infrared Emitter with lens  =  LKR 180
Piezo Sounder  =  LKR 110
16*2 LCD with I2C  =  LKR 450
RGB light *5  =  LKR 100
Vibration motor  *2  =  LKR 400
HC-05 Bluetooth module  =  LKR 500
Trigger and Reload buttons+wire  =  LKR 20
3000mAh rechargeable 5v  =  LKR 1100
#### Direct Material Cost  LKR 3185   Per unit

## CONTROLLER PLATFORMS

-   AtMega328 is programming using C language
### IR Library
-   Currently it is NEC IR protocol
-   38 KHz
- 8  bit is used

# Network technologies and protocols


Access and authentication

  

-   put username/password in the post body and send it over HTTPS
    

  

-   Identify the user & issue an access token and a refresh token by the server
    

  

-   Server verifies the user by the validity of the token
    

  

-   We can keep the players logged in the game app for long using refresh tokens

# [](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e16-3yp-smart-infared-shooting-sport/tree/main/docs#back-end-technologies) Back-end technologies
Firebase

- It is ideal for our Xtag mobile app.
- Cloud deployment -Firestore 
    - database helps to store real-time and synchronize game data.
- Firebase authentication library is used for authentication
    

Storage

-   Cloud Firestore
    

Fast performance, high availability, and security

# Database
 ![](images/db1.PNG)
 ![](images/db2.PNG)


- Two main collections are used to store Player data and Match data.
- Player collection will store records as documents according to the Used ID.
- Match collection will store records as documents according to the Match ID.
- Players' details of each match will be stored as a sub collection inside the relevent match document.


## Reasons behind the database
- When do a query search in a match, It will be efficient
- When player want see his paset, it will be efficient
- We can increase the efficiency of the system by deleting  old match data.
- There Are Some data in the match,which are useless later
     - Ex: isready,rescue code


# Tests done
    1. Authentication test (Integrated  security test)
    2. Network compatibility testing
    3. Data Mapping testing
    4. Stored Procedures(Black box testing)
    5. Device compatibility testing
The report of the results of these tests are uploaded in docs file.

 # Main Functionalities
 
- How to refresh the screen when players are connected
    - Streams are used
- Syncing the game time counter
- How to set a tempid
- How to give a score to the shooter
    - Query searching is done by the killed player
 

# User Interface - Mobile Application
Develop using Futter 1.17
