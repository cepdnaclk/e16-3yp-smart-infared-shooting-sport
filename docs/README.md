## OVERVIEW

X-tag is a Smart IR shooting sport.In currrent related product are, 
 
* very expensive
* Companies with large indoor environments charge up to $10 for a single game.
* Not enough game modes/options.
* Not smart enough.
* Not updatable

	Therefore In this Project we build a tag system with a central server and a mobile application.In that manner we were able to
	Create a updatable ,smart IR tag system.Also the cost of our system will be very lower compare to current products in the market.

## GOALS

* Shoot father up to 100ft
* And make cheaper to produce 
* And most importantly we want to make our system smart.

## SPECIFICATIONS
* There are mainly 3 parts in this project .Xtag gun and the headband to shoot and receive IR,Xtag mobile application to
  Choose game modes,initialize the game and a firebase server for communicate with in the game .
*  Every gun has a cababilty of shooting more than 30m and many features like LCD screen,LED lights,vibration motors.
*  The headband is connected to gun with a wired connection and it receive the IR signals shoots by other players.
*  Also Headband has 3 LEDs to indiacate the Team colour and Another LED to blink when get shotted.Those IR receivers and LEDs are locate in every 
   4 sides in the gun.
*  Inizialize the gun before the match,selecting the team,battle mode are done with the help of the Xtag mobile application.Gun is connecting to the mobile using Bluetooth.
*  Finding the shooter,giving scores,join to a battle are done with the help of the firebase server by connecting to it through the Xtag mobile application.
*  Thanks to our system artchtecture this system is updatable(Can be added more modes more option without changing the hardware) and a smart one.

## SOLUTION ARTCHTECTURE

![](images/blog.png)

* Every player has a head to reserve IR shots and IR gun to shoot IR.
	* when the platyer shoots he shoot with some data.They are,
		* Team ID
		* Damage
		* Player ID
		
	![](images/shotdata.png)
* Every players gun is connected to the mobile application through blutooth.
* Every phonr is connected to the our server.
* Using mobile application,
	* gun is initilized.
	* game mode is selected
* Server is used to,
	* comunicate with the gamne.
		* As a example Find who is the shooter and ,giving scores are done with the help of
		  the backend.
		  
## HARDWARE

* ### IR emitter

This is the heart of the this project and it is very challenging when we use IR communication for this kind of
purpose
* To shoot further we Planned used high power IR      
	* IR emitter - TSUS5202
	* power=   170mW , 150mA
* Since esp32 cant give 100 mA for the transistor is used 
	* BD139
* and a lens is used to focus 
	* Diameter about   -   38mm (1.5â€³)



* ### IR receiver

 	* SM0038 - TSOP1738 - 38KHz IR receiver 	
 	* This Moduile has built in   
	*  signal amplifier
	*   2.5 V to 5.5 V
  
* ### LCD screen 16x2 with I2C module

 	* standard HD44780  	
 	* 5V

* ### sunder

 	* Buzzer Piezo Bleeper Sounder  	
 	* Frequency 4kHz 	
 	* power - 10mA
 - 
* ### vibration motor
	
 	* 10000RPM Metal Brush
 	* DC 3.7V 5V  135mA-180mA

And also push button and RGB LED are used.

* ### IR Receiver

![](images/TSOP1738-Pin-Configuration.png)
SM0038 - TSOP1738 IR Receiver


 1. 3 pin
 2.   38KHz
 3.   -40 to +80C
 4.   2.5 V to 5.5 V
 5.   binary (data) 
 ![](images/TSOP1738-Block-Diagram.png)



* ## CONTROLLER PLATFORMS

	* NodeMCU esp32 duel core microtroller
* ### IR Library
  	* Currently it is NEC IR protocol
   	* 38 KHz
 	* 8  bit is used

* ### implementation

- Design seperated into several parts for the ease of 3D printing

* ### Fabrication circuit
* Used small circuits that are connected to the main circuit for
	* Switch buttons
	* LEDs
	* Vibrator motor
	* IR emitter
	* Buzzer


* Connections are done according to the NODE MCU esp32 datasheet

## BACKEND
* ### Access and authentication

Using Email and a password players can register Xtag
Players have to verify their  Email before signed in
More detail will be on testing report

	* It is ideal for our Xtag mobile app.
	* Cloud deployment -Firestore 
		* database helps to store real-time and synchronize game data.
	* Firebase authentication library is used for authentication
    

* ### Storage

	* Cloud Firestore


	Fast performance, high availability, and security

* ### Database
	 ![](images/db1.PNG)
	 ![](images/db2.PNG)


	* Two main collections are used to store Player data and Match data.
	* Player collection will store records as documents according to the Used ID.
	* Match collection will store records as documents according to the Match ID.
	* Players' details of each match will be stored as a sub collection inside the relevent match document.


* ### Reasons behind the database
	* When do a query search in a match, It will be efficient
	* When player want see his paset, it will be efficient
	* We can increase the efficiency of the system by deleting  old match data.
	* There Are Some data in the match,which are useless later
		* 	Ex: isready,rescue code

## MOBILE APP.

* ### Main Functionalities
 
	* How to refresh the screen when players are connected
	 	 * Streams are used
	* Syncing the game time counter
	* How to set a tempid
	* How to give a score to the shooter
	  	  * Query searching is done by the killed player


* ### User Interface - Mobile Application
Develop using Futter 1.17 

* ### Home page
