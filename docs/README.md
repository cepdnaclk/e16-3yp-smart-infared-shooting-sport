### X-TAG  Smart infrared shooting sport:

Infrared games are originated in the united states as a replicate of star wars laser wars 
which is a popular movie hit.Now laser/IR shooting sports are popular in all over the world.
There are many Commercial laser tag and Toy class guns are available in the market now.

### But why we need X-TAG which is our new smart infrared shooting sport system:

* current related product are,
* very expensive
* Companies with large indoor environments charge up to $10 for a single game.
* Not enough game modes/options.
* Not smart enough.
* Not updatable


### So we planned develop a new system which is:

* Shoot father up to 100ft
* And make cheaper to produce 
* And most importantly we want to make our system smart.
Hardware list
IR emitter
This is the heart of the this project and it is very challenging when we use IR communication for this kind of purpose. To shoot further we Planned used high power IR
IR emitter - TSUS5202 power= 170mW , 150mA Since Atmega IC cant give 100 mA for the transistor is used BD139 and a lens is used to focus - Diameter about 38mm (1.5″)

IR reviser
SM0038 - TSOP1738 - 38KHz IR receiver
This Moduile has built in
signal amplifier
2.5 V to 5.5 V
LCD screen 16x2 with I2C module
standard HD44780
5V
sunder
Buzzer Piezo Bleeper Sounder
Frequency 4kHz
power - 10mA
vibration motor
10000RPM Metal Brush
DC 3.7V 5V 135mA-180mA
And also push button and RGB LED are used.

### Target audiences:

* Companies  for Commercial laser tag systems ,
* and any other user who like to buy a pair of guns or more.
