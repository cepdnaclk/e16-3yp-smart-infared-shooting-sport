### IR emitter

This is the heart of the this project and it is very challenging when we use IR communication for this kind of
purpose.
**To shoot further we Planned used high power IR**       
	IR emitter - TSUS5202
		power=   170mW , 150mA
**Since Atmega IC cant give 100 mA for the transistor is used**
	BD139
**and a lens is used to focus**
	-   Diameter about      38mm (1.5â€³)


### IR reviser

 - SM0038 - TSOP1738 - 38KHz IR receiver 	
 - This Moduile has built in   
 -  signal amplifier
 -    2.5 V to 5.5 V
  
### LCD screen 16x2 with I2C module

 - standard HD44780  	
 - 5V

### sunder

 - Buzzer Piezo Bleeper Sounder  	
 - Frequency 4kHz 	
 - power - 10mA
 - 
### vibration motor
	
 - 10000RPM Metal Brush
 - 	DC 3.7V 5V  135mA-180mA

And also push button and RGB LED are used.
